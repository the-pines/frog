# Go To Market (GTM) and Marketing Strategy

We have built this app with GTM in mind, incorporating features that increase virality and community even when Frog Pay is still on testnet. We believe that Frog Pay and Lisk can work closely together to build a narrative pushing how Lisk‚Äôs regional focus allows for this app to go worldwide. Launching with help from Lisk will increase visibility for both brands and bring real users and liquidity to Frog Pay from across the globe.

The following document details how we envision our GTM strategy, and how a partnership with the Lisk Foundation may look as we approach mainnet. We expect to roll out a full mainnet launch in 6 months.

# Phase 0 - hackathon wrapup

_Goal: Refine our app_

**August 31 - September 15**

We already have a working end-to-end live app integrated with our Stripe sandbox environment. We have received feedback from many hackathon attendees (and non-crypto people) that the experience feels smooth and seamless. In this phase, we will mainly work towards keeping in touch with the people who loved our app already and refining our features.

## Definition of done:

- A feature-complete payments app with virtual card issuing
  - Virtual card issuing and payments
  - Collaborative vaults
  - User creation and deletion
  - Seamless wallet flow - the user should not need an existing wallet, and should be able to make a smart wallet with social login
  - Gasless transactions for all transactions
    - We implemented this for vault creation over the weekend, and will continue to roll this out for all onchain features of the app
- A very small glasseaters community in Mexico City
  - Over 50% of Mexican adults are unbanked - this is an incredible opportunity to tap into. We are based in LATAM so it is easy to foster a community here. We have already met a small group of people who really understand and love what we are doing, and have given us incredible feedback that has helped shape this document. This is key to our strategy.
- Landing page and X account
  - Support from Lisk Foundation in growing our social presence (not too much yet)

# Phase 1 - awareness and credibility

_Goal: Testnet users in LATAM, product feedback, and social media relevance_

**September 15 - October 15**

In this phase we mainly focus on building our awareness in LATAM (focused on Argentina, our home). The aim is to increase trust in this communities by being able to listen to feedback and give support in a direct non-scalable way. This will lead to organic growth and trust, very important as we want to take over a user‚Äôs (or be their first) a bank account.

## Who are our users?

In this phase we will focus on two personas - active users of crypto and street vendors in CDMX and Buenos Aires.

### Active users of crypto

**Motivations**

- Status & experimentation - they like trying the newest chains and being early in protocols
- Airdrop hunting - they‚Äôll engage heavily if they believe it may count toward future rewards
- Financial freedom - they dislike the friction and centralization of banks, they are not necessarily unbanked
- Community - crypto Twitter, Telegram groups, and Discord

**Pain points**

- Dapps feel abstract (no IRL use case they can show friends and brag)
- High inflation (especially Argentina peso), banking restrictions, travel difficulties

**GTM voice**

- Get involved early to simulate real payments before being live on mainnet
- Hinting (but not promising) at airdrops through the points system
- Buy tacos or mate with crypto
- Leaderboards, streaks, and gamified payments

### Street vendors

**Motivations**

- More customers - lots of people, especially tourists, expect to be able to pay with card
- Faster, easier payments
- Potential future upside through points systems or rewards

**Pain points**

- Trust - holding unusable coins, instability
- Complexity - don‚Äôt want to manage seed phrases or technical setup
- Uncertain legality - filing taxes can be difficult

**GTM voice**

- Simple flow to get started, easier than a bank
- Incentives: Get free coffee for payments and points
- Being involved in local community and marketing: ‚ÄúThe first street vendor in CDMX to accept Frog Pay!‚Äù
- Easily downloadable statements that help them understand what they are making

# Phase 3 - regional growth loops and stickiness

_Goal: Broaden to S√£o Paulo / Bogot√° / Santiago, and grow organically, 1000 active users_

This phase mainly focuses on strengthening and growing our LATAM communities, allowing them to exponentially grow organically themselves. This will be a phase of many small social campaigns that incentivize people to onboard friends, use the app, and continue to support each other. The Frog Pay team can start to be more hands-off with this community and begin to focus our strategy to the rest of the world.

## Tactics and campaigns

**Referral Program**

- Invite friends ‚Üí both get Points and higher on the leaderboard
- Top 100 referrers win real-world prizes (gift cards, merch)

**Leaderboards & competitions**

- Track who does the most ‚Äúpayments‚Äù
- Track points and have weekly leaderboards with small onchain prizes such as NFT badges
- Payment streaks for NFTs, can grow with friends

**Street Vendor Simulation (CDMX)**

- Recruit a few vendors to accept payments and give them slightly more
- Film and share on social media

**Community Hangouts**

- Host small consistent meetups in coworking spaces or caf√©s
- Continue to get involved in other community events

## Definition of Done

- 1,000 active weekly users across LATAM
- 3‚Äì5 consistent street vendor partners in CDMX and BA using the app in daily flow
- 500+ successful referral-based signups
- Social proof content circulating weekly (user videos, vendor spotlights)

# Phase 4 - expansion and virality: mainnet

_Goals: Expand into Europe hubs (London, Berlin, Lisbon) and increase presence all over the online world drastically, 2000 active users_

Now that we have built trust and community we can start expanding into the world‚Äôs major crypto hubs. Although there is a market in the USA, it is recommended that we avoid it until their crypto policies become clearer. We will focus a lot on online growth and major cities, really pushing our brand image, colours, and tone. Our goal is to be remembered - if you‚Äôre ‚Äúin‚Äù crypto and you haven‚Äôt heard of Frog Pay, you‚Äôre behind.

## Who are our users?

### Active users of crypto

We covered this persona earlier in the document.

### Tradfi users and ‚Äúnormies‚Äù

**Motivations**

- Lower fees and faster settlement than their banks, especially for cross-border payments
- Reliability
- Flexibility when traveling
- Prestige of being ‚Äúahead‚Äù on fintech trends (similar to Revolut or Wise early adopters)

**Pain points**

- Bank friction
- High FX fees when traveling or sending money abroad
- Poor UX of legacy banking apps, clunky KYC processes
- A really huge suspicion and general dislike of crypto

**GTM voice**

- Instant, borderless payments
- Statistics, numbers, testimonials
- Emphasize stability, compliance, and trust - no heavy ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù jargon

We will not target street vendors and the ‚Äúunbanked‚Äù so actively at this phase. We expect that our small communities in CDMX and Buenos Aires will continue to grow and strengthen organically.

### Tactics and campaigns

**Reliance on our app**

## Phase 5 - Total world domination

_Goal: Be the default narrative of crypto payments, and the most visible Lisk app that is almost simultaneous with Lisk itself_

In this final phase we are no longer ‚Äújust another app.‚Äù Frog Pay should become shorthand for what it looks like to actually spend crypto

### Tactics and campaigns

- Mainstream media hits: Work with PR to appear in Wired, Bloomberg, etc
- Ambassador program: Appoint local champions in 20+ global cities to run small meetups, vendor onboarding, and campaigns

### Who are our users?
